name: clean-copy
description: Cut interface copy that shouldn't exist — captions that restate a label, hints that pre-empt a worry the user never had, warnings that are scar tissue from a fixed bug. Use when writing or reviewing any user-facing string (labels, hints, empty states, toasts, confirmations, button text), or when asked to clean up / tighten copy.

# Cleaning copy

Most bad copy isn't badly written. It's copy that shouldn't be on the screen. Editing it for
tone just makes the wrong thing read better. So the first question is never "how should this
be phrased" — it's **should this exist**.

## The ladder

Walk a string down these in order. Stop at the first one that fires and delete.

**1. Does this need to surface at all?**
Is the thing being described something the user would ever have wondered about, unprompted? If
they'd never have thought to ask, you're not answering a question — you're planting one. Nobody
opens an avatar cropper wondering whether the circle is a true circle. A caption reading "the
preview is rendered at the exact size used on your profile" makes them wonder whether it might
not be.

**2. Does the label need to exist?**
A caption earns its place only when the value is meaningless without it. If the label, the
field, or the value beside it already says the thing, the caption is noise. A field labelled
"Retry limit" does not need "how many times we retry" beneath it. A bare "30" does need
"seconds" beside it — that one stays.

**3. Is it pre-empting something the user would never have had to consider?**
The tell: copy that rules out a failure rather than describing a behaviour.

> Cancel upload
> *Always keeps the files already transferred — never wipes the folder like the old cancel did.*

That second clause exists because of a bug. The user doesn't know about the bug, doesn't share
your memory of fixing it, and now has a worry they arrived without. **The fix for a fixed bug
is the fix. Not a caption about the fix.** Same for copy defending a design decision, or
hedging about something that simply works: "this may look slow but it is not", "don't worry if
the count seems off for a moment".

**4. Rewrite to remove the offending part. If nothing is left, delete the element.**
Don't preserve a hint just because there was a hint there. An empty `hint` prop comes off the
component; an explanatory `<p>` gets deleted, not shortened to a stub.

## What survives

Copy stays when the user genuinely cannot act without it:

- A real consequence at the moment of choosing. Under a destructive button: *"Anything not yet
  synced is lost."* They need it before they click, and they can't infer it.
- A compatibility or scope fact they can't see. *"Works with keys issued after March; older
  keys need rotating first."* The checkbox alone doesn't tell them whether it applies to them.
- What a blank state means and what to do next. *"No projects yet. Create one and it will
  appear here."*
- Units, scale, or format on a bare value.

Note the first example is one sentence. Had it continued *"— only use this when a sync is
stuck"*, that half would go: it instructs the user on when they're allowed to press a button
they can already see. Keep the consequence, cut the permission slip.

## Working style

- Read the string next to what's actually on screen around it — the label, the value, the
  button. Redundancy is invisible when you read the string alone.
- Cut whole clauses, not words. Tightening "Leave this blank to use the default setting for
  your account" into "Leave blank for the default" is a smaller win than noticing which half of
  a two-sentence hint is doing no work.
- When reviewing a batch, report as `file:line` with the current string and either the rewrite
  or `cut` — and say in a few words which rung it failed. Don't rewrite copy that passes.
- If a string is load-bearing but only in a rare state, consider whether it belongs in that
  state rather than permanently on the page.
